Abstract
The project emphasizes on machine learning investigation to enhance predictive performance on red wine data. 
The analysis is conducted using Python language. Using performance metric function, important features are selected and 
remove the sulfur dioxide column. Subsequently, the new subset of dataset is used to train machine learning models. 
Following the multiple data modelling, CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM are identified as best estimators for predicting wine quality. Normalization of input variables contributed to overall performance improvement. Further refinement includes fine tuning and the application of advanced ensemble techniques such as blending and stacking. These techniques aim to harness the collective predictive power of multiple models, ultimately enhancing overall performance. The stacked model which combines the top three individual models, demonstrates excellent predictive capabilities, achieving the highest MAE, MSE and R2 metric. These findings contribute valuable insights into wine quality prediction, emphasizing the importance of meticulous preprocessing and ensemble methodologies for optimal machine learning outcomes in the context of red wine data.
